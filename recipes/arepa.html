      I first tasted <strong>arepas</strong> at a New York City hole-in-the-wall
      eatery and I fell in love with this stuffed white corn cake. Halfway
      through my first arepa - one stuffed with black beans, beef, plantains,
      and salty cheese - I vowed to learn how to make these at home. It's a
      truly magnificent delivery system for any number of your favorite
      fillings. I went with some spicy pork and avocado, but I made a version a
      few days later stuffed with caramelized plantains and salty goat feta.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.Â®)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in
        cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist,
        malleable dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten
        into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches
        until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked
        arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to
        handle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife
        to form a pita-like pocket.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
